Create a React Spinner component

Mounts the hamster Lottie animation into the #hamster container.

Plays the animation in a loop until hidden.

Uses React lifecycle (useEffect) to initialise the animation.

Example (for illustration only):

tsx
useEffect(() => {
  lottie.loadAnimation({
    container: document.getElementById('hamster'),
    renderer: 'svg',
    loop: true,
    autoplay: true,
    path: '/assets/hamster.json'
  });
}, []);
Control spinner visibility via React state

Introduce a showSpinner state.

Default: true when a new page or route is loading.

Set to false once the page’s data/component is ready.

Apply a 150ms delay before showing the spinner, so it only appears if loading takes longer than that.

This avoids the spinner flashing on instant loads.

Example logic (illustration only):

tsx
const [showSpinner, setShowSpinner] = useState(false);

useEffect(() => {
  const timeout = setTimeout(() => setShowSpinner(true), 150);
  return () => clearTimeout(timeout);
}, []);
Tie spinner lifecycle to React Router transitions

Show spinner when navigating to a new route.

Hide spinner once the new route’s component has mounted and data is ready.

Ensure this does not interfere with existing fade/slide transitions — spinner should only cover the screen before the transition begins, and disappear once the new screen is ready to animate.

Ensure smooth UX

On fast loads (<150ms): spinner never appears, transitions run normally.

On slower loads (>150ms): spinner appears over a white background, disappears once ready, then transitions run.

No flicker of half‑rendered content should be visible.

Remove inline JS from index.html

The spinner should be fully controlled by React, not by window.onload.

Keep the container and styles in index.html as the base scaffold.

Subtleties to respect:

Spinner must not block or delay fast transitions.

Spinner must not overlap fade/slide animations — it should disappear before those begin.

Spinner should be full‑screen white background with hamster animation centered.

Accessibility: add aria-label="Loading" to the spinner container.

Ensure the hamster JSON path is correct (/assets/hamster.json).

Deliverables:

A React Spinner component.

Integration into the app’s router/data‑loading flow.

Removal of inline JS from index.html.

Confirmation that fade/slide transitions still work as intended.
