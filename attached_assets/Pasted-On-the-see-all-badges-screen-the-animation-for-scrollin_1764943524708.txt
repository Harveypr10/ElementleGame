On the “see all” badges screen, the animation for scrolling up or down to show each row of badges is broadly working, but the swipe and button presses aren’t quite working as they should. Can you make it so:
-	The first row of badges to load are the “Won In” badges (this is already how it works), and the up arrow is shown. When you click the arrow or scroll the screen upwards the badges row shows as animating upwards, and fading out, and the new badges row animates in from below, fading in. Can you also remove the “bounce back” of the row being scrolled, so that it just continues on upwards as it fades out, and only let it “bounce back” if the user doesn’t scroll far enough to trigger the row to be changed
-	The second row of badges shown is the “Streak” badges (this is already how it works), and the up and down arrows are shown (also already how it works). When you click the up arrow or scroll the screen upwards the badges row shows as animating upwards, fading out, and the new badges row animates in from below, fading in. The opposite should happen when clicking the down arrow or scrolling the badges image down. Can you also remove the “bounce back” of the row being scrolled, so that it just continues on upwards (or downwards) as it fades out, and only let it “bounce back” if the user doesn’t scroll far enough to trigger the row to be changed
-	The third row of badges to load are the “Top % Rank” (change the title please) badges (this is already how it works), and the down arrow is shown. When you click the arrow or scroll the screen downwards the badges row shows as animating downwards, fading out, and the new badges row animates in from above, fading in. Can you also remove the “bounce back” of the row being scrolled, so that it just continues on downwards as it fades out, and only let it “bounce back” if the user doesn’t scroll far enough to trigger the row to be changed
Can you also remove the icons shown next to the titles above the rows of badges. Can you move the 3 dot toggle slightly upwards, so it sits evenly spaced between the down button below and the “Earned!” text above. Can you increase the size of the badge images by 20%. Can you constrain it, so if the badges start to be scrolled left or right, to change between badges in the same category, they then can’t scrolled up or down at the same time. And when they are scrolled up or down, to change between badge categories, they can’t be scrolled left or right at the same time.
