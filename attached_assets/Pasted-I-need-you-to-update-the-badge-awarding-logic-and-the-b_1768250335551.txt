I need you to update the badge‑awarding logic and the badge UI. Please follow these instructions carefully.

## PART 1 — Update backend badge awarding logic (server/storage.ts)

The `user_badges` table in Supabase ALREADY has a column called `badge_count` (integer, default 1). DO NOT create a new column. DO NOT modify the schema.

Update BOTH of these backend functions:

- checkAndAwardElementleBadge(...)
- checkAndAwardStreakBadge(...)

They currently:
1. Check if the user already has the badge (same badge_id, same game_type, same region)
2. If not, they insert a new row with is_awarded = false
3. If yes, they return null and do nothing

I need you to change this behaviour:

### NEW LOGIC:
- If the user does NOT already have the badge → insert a new row with badge_count = 1 (this already happens)
- If the user DOES already have the badge → DO NOT return null  
  Instead:
  - Increment badge_count by 1
  - Set is_awarded = false (so the popup will show again)
  - Return the updated badge so the popup can display it

This must be done for BOTH Elementle‑in‑1/2 badges and Streak badges.

Be careful:
- Only increment badge_count for the SAME badge_id + SAME region + SAME game_type
- Do NOT create duplicate rows
- Do NOT modify any other badge logic
- Do NOT modify percentile badge logic

## PART 2 — Update the badge popup UI

File: BadgeCelebrationPopup

I need you to add a small text label BELOW the hamster image that shows:
- “x2” if badge_count = 2
- “x3” if badge_count = 3
- etc.
If badge_count = 1 then don’t show anything additional on screen

Use the badge_count returned from the backend (it is included in the user_badges row).

Styling:
- Place it centered below the hamster image
- Use a subtle but visible style (e.g., small bold text)
- Apart from vertical spacing to allow it to fit in, do NOT change the layout of anything else

## PART 3 — Update the “View All Badges” screen

File: AllBadgesPopup

I need you to add the same “xN” label BELOW the “Earned” icon:
- For this one do show “x1” if badge_count = 1
- And show “x2”, “x3”, etc. for higher counts

This applies to:
- Elementle badges
- Streak badges
- Percentile badges (which already have badge_count updated from the monthly job)

Make sure:
- The label is small and centered
- It does not break the grid layout
- It appears only if the user has earned the badge and a row exists in the user_badges table

## PART 4 — Do NOT modify anything else

- Do NOT create new DB fields
- Do NOT rename existing fields
- Do NOT change the badge popup logic except for adding the count
- Do NOT change the badge awarding flow for percentile badges
- Do NOT change the API routes
- Do NOT change the badge thresholds

Please implement all of the above changes.
