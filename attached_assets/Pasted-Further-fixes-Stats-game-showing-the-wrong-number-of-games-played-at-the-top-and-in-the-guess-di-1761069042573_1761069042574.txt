Further fixes:
- Stats game showing the wrong number of games played at the top and in the guess distribution for the user paul10harvey@gmail.com. They've only played 2 games, which is correctly shown in the Last 30 Days part, but it says 3 played at the top and in the Guess Distribution list. The data however, does look correct for user test2@test2.com
- When a user starts a game, but exits when only partially complete, it needs to be logged as an incomplete attempt within the game_attempts result field (perhaps set to NULL, so that these records can be ignored when calculating game performance), and the guesses so far should be logged in the guesses table. This should trigger when the user clicks the enter button each time to register a new guess, recoding the data as they go. When the user then returns to the partially completed date the guesses should be brought up and displayed and the user can continue from the next empty row to add more guesses
- When the user correctly guesses the answer the streak screen shouldn't be displayed until after all the numbers have changed to green and a light blue glow has pulsed on and off around the correct answer number boxes 3 times over a 2 second duration. When the user gets it wrong for the 5th time, failing to win the game, the game shouldn't move to the commiseration screen until after all the numbers have changed to show which were right and wrong and there has been a 2 second duration after the colours have been revealed.
- When the user returns to a completed game that they lost, the actual answer should show below the number matrix, in the same style as the number matrix, with each box in green. The gap to the number matrix above should be 3 times the size of the gap between each row of the number matrix
