Further fixes:
- Fade in the SplashScreen, text and image over the first 1 second the screen is shown
- Don't show the login screen after the welcome SplashScreen if the user is already logged in, go straight to the GameSelectionPage
- Replace the cross image with the .svg version in the attached_assets folder "White-Cross-Blue.svg"
- Reduce the 4 hamster picture sizes by 10% on the GameSelectionPage
- Archive, Stats and GameSelectionScreen are not using the correct data, as they are showing that the Test2@test2.com user has gotten today's puzzle wrong, even though they got it right. It looks like it's still trying to pull from local memory, as when I clear the local memory the screens all reset, even though there is game data in the relevant tables within Supabase. Can you go through the links that pull the data into the components on each screen and correctly pull from the Supabase tables. The StreakCelebrationPopup and EndGameModal are also not showing the right data
- When the options are changed in Options, they also aren't being remembered in the Supabase table, so when the user goes back in they are show a reset Options screen
- Toggling clues off in the options menu should remove the event-title from the PlayPage (both for today and if played from Archive)
- When a new user signs up, send an email verification email to their address, and then record whether they have clicked the link and verified their email within the user_profiles able in Supabase. Let the user continue to use their account and play the daily game, but disable the Archive button until their email address has been verified. Whilst not verified, add the wording "Verify email address to enable" to the Archive button, below "Archive" in the same font as the date is written in the "Play today's puzzle" button above
- Show the user's existing Profile Information in the Account Information page (don't show the current password). If they change the email address and click save then show a pop up to confirm they want to proceed stating "A verification email will be sent to your new address. Archive will be disabled until your address is verified. Proceed?" with "Continue" or "Cancel" buttons at the bottom of the pop up. If they "Continue", send the verification email link, reset the flag in the supabase user_profiles table to unverified and disable the Archive button, until the user has verified their new email address
