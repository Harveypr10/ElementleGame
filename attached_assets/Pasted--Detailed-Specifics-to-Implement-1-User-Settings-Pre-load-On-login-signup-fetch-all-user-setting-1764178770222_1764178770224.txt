📋 Detailed Specifics to Implement
1. User Settings Pre‑load
On login/signup, fetch all user settings (theme, toggles, preferences, subscription status).

Store them in a global cache/context (e.g. React Query cache, Zustand, or Redux).

Ensure every screen that depends on settings reads from cache instantly, not by firing a fresh DB call on mount.

2. Category Preferences (Pro Users)
When a Pro user logs in, pre‑fetch their category preferences.

Cache them so that CategorySelectionScreen always shows the existing preferences immediately.

No flicker between “empty” and “loaded” states.

3. First Name Pre‑load
Fetch and cache the user’s first name at login.

Ensure GameSelectionPage always shows the name instantly in the “Personal” toggle box.

Avoid the flicker where it shows “Personal” then switches to the name after DB response.

4. Image Pre‑loading
Pre‑load all images/icons (e.g. banners, buttons, logos) into memory when the app starts.

Use a preload manifest or new Image().src = ... calls to cache them.

Ensure screens only render once their images are ready, so there’s no “late appearing” assets.

Prefer a short pause before screen load rather than images popping in after render.

5. Background Refresh
After key events (login, signup, finishing a game), trigger background refreshes of cached data (profile, stats, preferences).

This ensures the next screen navigated to already has fresh data.

6. Implementation Notes
Use React Query’s prefetchQuery or equivalent to warm caches before navigation.

Wrap screens in Suspense or a preload provider so they don’t render until required data is ready.

Provide skeleton loaders only if absolutely necessary, but the default should be “screen waits until ready.”

Document which queries are pre‑loaded at login and after game completion.
