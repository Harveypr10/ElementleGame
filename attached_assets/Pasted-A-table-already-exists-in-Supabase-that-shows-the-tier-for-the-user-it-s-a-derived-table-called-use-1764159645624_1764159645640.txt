A table already exists in Supabase that shows the tier for the user, it’s a derived table called user_current_tier, containing user_id and tier. “free” is the standard tier and “pro” the pro tier. Please link to this table to decide if a user is standard or pro
When loading the game up the WelcomePage should always show and then, if the user is still signed in from a previous visit, should go through to the GameSelectionPage in the logged in version, and if the user isn’t logged in then still go through to the GameSelectionPage, which should look exactly the same, but with the restrictions on how they can use this page as described previously (included again below).
When the user clicks “sign out” on the Settings page, they should be taken back the WelcomePage, and then the login/signup page should show, but with a new option below to “Continue without signing in”, which when clicked should take you to the GameSelectionPage as an un-signed-in user. There shouldn’t be a “login” button shown on the GameSelectionPage at any point, and the “UK Edition” / “Personal” toggle should always be on screen even if not logged in. The game needs to be loaded for today’s puzzle, so that they player can immediately click on “Play today’s puzzle”.
Never show scroll bars on any screen, even if the containers and components go off the edge limits of the screen
Orange ads button to the right hand side, and the UK/Personal toggle should be at the same level. Squeeze the width of the button if needed, and make the “Ads on” text non-bold, and the “Go Pro” text bold and one font size larger.
The user name is re-loading each time the user returns to the GameSelectionPage, meaning it initially shows as “Personal” and then changes after a second or so. This needs to be saved locally when the user first signs in, or loads up when signed in, so the user’s name is always displayed immediately on entering the GameSelectionPage. This should be the same for the “UK Edition” text in the global game.
When the user has a long name, increase the width of the toggle to fit in the name, increasing the size of the global game side too, so they stay symmetrical and centrally aligned on the screen. If the name is very long then shrink the text size down so as not to overlap with the “Go Pro” button. If the number of character for the name is 12 or above then revert to “Personal”.
On the new “Go Pro” option in the Settings menu, when this is clicked on and the user is not pro then this should bring up the same screen as the “Go Pro” button on the main screen.
Make sure every page background fills the entire space of the screen. For example almost all pages, such as the WelcomePage and GameSelectionPage, don’t run to the bottom of the screen when on a narrow, but tall mobile device, leaving a white/grey area at the bottom
